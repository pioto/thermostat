# thermostat
A little app to prototype experiments with my Radio Thermostat

This is an app I've thrown together quickly with Spring Boot, in part just to play with some of its shiny looking
features, to try to get some quick progress on some automation for my thermostat.

I have an older "CT 30" model of the Radio Thermostat: http://www.radiothermostat.com/

I started this project because I wanted to try for a fresh start at what I had tried on
https://github.com/pioto/radio-thermostat before... This approach feels much cleaner and simpler, but if you aren't a big fan
of Spring then it may not work for you.
